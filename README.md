Customer segmentation is the act of grouping your audience into sub-categories based on similarities in user profiles. Segmentation allows you to find the best content, channel, and timing for your campaigns to be sent to potential leads or current customers.

    + Demographic: Based on customer demographic information such as gender, age group, income, and occupation.
    + Geographic: Based on customer location-related details such as country, region, city, weather, and more.
    + Psychographic: Based on customer psychological details such as goals, interests, and personality traits, to name a few key   ones.
    + Behavioral: Based on customer behavioral information such as website engagement, new/returning customers, brand engagement,  and purchase intention.

## ABOUT RFM ANALYSIS

RFM analysis is a type of customer segmentation that aims at analyzing the purchasing habits of customers there by helping to categorize different segments of customers by importance
RFM which stands for :

    + RECENCY (most recent purchase by customer) 
    + FREQUENCY (how often the customer has transacted) 
    + MONETARY (the total amount spent by customer during the time period looked at).

## RESULTS 
    After performing the RFM analysis i came up with the following results.

   + Customers in segment 5 purchase products more than any other segment by a wide margin they average about 856 purchases during that span the closest being segment 4.

   + Also segment 5 as seen from the plot below average the least recency meaning the last time they purchased the products was just 12 days ago compared to customers in segment 1 which averages 198 days 

   + Also we can see the disparity in average money spent from segment 5 to the rest with the average amount spent decreasing by segment.
